Q: Use key pairs ? Or shared secret to generate and verify JWT tokens ? \
A: Use certificate pairs

Q: How to share pre-generated public key to verify JWT toknes ? \
A: I won't use shared one time public certificate.
   I will generate keypair every time application is starting and will push public certificate to other microservices.
   
Q: What if we want to change key pair used to generate JWT tokens ? \
A: We will push public certificate again, each microservice can store multiple public certificates. So JWT tokens generated by old certs are still valid. After some time old cert is removed from cache.
